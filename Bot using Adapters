from chatterbot import ChatBot

#Create Chatbot Instance
bot = ChatBot("buddy")

#You can position the storage adapter with the chatbot object. 
# Storage Adapters allows you to connect to a particular storage unit or network. 
# For using a storage adapter, we need to specify it. 
# We will position the storage adapter by assigning it to the import path of the storage we want to use. 
# Here we are using SQL Storage Adapter, which permits chatbot to connect to databases in SQL. 
# By using the database parameter, 
# we will create a new SQLite Database. Please follow the code below, for creating a new database for chatbot.


# Create object of ChatBot class with Storage Adapter
bot = ChatBot(
    'Buddy',
    storage_adapter='chatterbot.storage.SQLStorageAdapter',
    database_uri='sqlite:///database.sqlite3'
)

# Create object of ChatBot class with Logic Adapter
bot = ChatBot(
    'Buddy',  
    logic_adapters=[
        'chatterbot.logic.BestMatch',
        'chatterbot.logic.TimeLogicAdapter'],
)

#Training the chatbot
 #let's import the ListTrainer, 
 #create its object by passing the Chatbot object, 
 # and call the train() method by passing a list of sentences.

 # Inport ListTrainer
from chatterbot.trainers import ListTrainer
trainer = ListTrainer(bot)
trainer.train([
'Hi',
'Hello',
'Hello',
"Hi",
"How are you",
"I am good, what about you",
"tell me who is the strongest male avenger",
"Very Obvious,its Hulk",
"and female",
"Captain Marvel",
"do you like marvel",
"yes,like you, i love marvel",
"have you heard about friends reunion",
"indeed,the shooting for same has started earlier this week",
"yes i am very excited",
"yes,me too",
'I need your assistance regarding my order',
'Please, Provide me with your order id',
'I have a complaint.',
'Please elaborate, your concern',
'How long it will take to receive an order ?',
'An order takes 3-5 Business days to get delivered.',
'Okay Thanks',
'No Problem! Have a Good Day!'
])

#Chatbot Testing
#The last step of this tutorial is to test the chatterbotâ€™s conversational skills. 
#For testing its responses, we will call the get_responses() method of Chatbot instance.

# Get a response to the input text 'I would like to book a flight.'
response = bot.get_response('I have a complaint.')
print("Bot Response:", response)

#We will create a while loop for our chatbot to run in. 
# When statements are passed in the loop, we will get an appropriate response for it,
#  as we have already entered data into our database.
#  If we get "Bye" or "bye" statement from the user, we can put an end to the loop and stop the program.

name=input("Enter Your Name: ")
print("Welcome to the Bot Service! Let me know how can I help you?")
while True:
    request=input(name+':')
    if request=='Bye' or request =='bye':
        print('Bot: Bye')
        break
    else:
        response=bot.get_response(request)
        print('Bot:',response)
